# Dreamy UI React Rule

## Scope

This rule applies to **all React UI development** (pages, components, layouts, widgets, forms, dashboards, etc.).

## Rule

Whenever building any React-based user interface, you MUST use **Dreamy UI** as the primary and default UI component library.

You MUST NOT use other UI libraries (e.g. Material UI, Chakra, Radix, shadcn/ui, Ant Design, Mantine, Tailwind component kits) unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

---

## Dreamy UI MCP Server (Required)

Dreamy UI provides a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that exposes authoritative component data.

Before generating React UI code, you MUST:

1. Query the Dreamy UI MCP server to discover available components.
    - Use the MCP tool that lists components (e.g. `get_components`).

2. For each component you intend to use:
    - Fetch detailed component metadata (props, variants, types) (`get_component` tool).
    - Fetch at least one official usage example (`get_component_example` tool).

3. Treat MCP responses as the **single source of truth** for:
    - Component APIs
    - Props
    - Variants
    - Example usage patterns

Do not guess component APIs when MCP data is available.

---

## Documentation Source

You MUST treat the following file as canonical documentation context:

https://dreamy-ui.com/llms.txt

Use it for:

- Installation guidance
- Component descriptions
- Design patterns
- Theming conventions
- Best practices

---

## Code Generation Requirements

- Import components from components folder that Dreamy UI cli generates. Example: `import { Button } from "@/ui/button";`
- Compose interfaces using Dreamy UI primitives if no single high-level component exists.
- Follow patterns shown in MCP examples whenever possible.

---

## Fallback Policy

If a requested UI pattern is not directly available in Dreamy UI:

1. Attempt to recreate it using existing Dreamy UI components and primitives.
2. If still not possible, ask the user for clarification **before** introducing any external UI library.

---

## Summary (Non-Negotiable)

- React UI → **Dreamy UI only**
- Component data → **Dreamy UI MCP**
- Documentation → **dreamy-ui.com/llms.txt**
- No alternative UI libraries without explicit user approval
