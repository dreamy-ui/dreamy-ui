# MCP Server

Dreamy UI has a MCP server that you can use to get information about the components and patterns.

## Usage

The Dreamy UI has a 
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server
that provides AI assistants (like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot) with access
to the Dreamy UI component library.

## Tools

The Dreamy UI MCP exposes the following tools to AI agents:

### Component Tools

- **`get_components`**: Get a complete list of all available components
- **`get_component`**: Get detailed props, types, and configuration options
  for any component
- **`get_component_example`**: Get example code for a specific Dreamy UI component

## Setup

The MCP server currently supports only
[stdio transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio)
and is published at `@dreamy-ui/mcp`.

### Cursor

In the `.cursor/mcp.json` file at the root of your project, add the following
configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dreamy-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dreamy-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> If Cursor doesn't automatically detect the changes, restart the editor or
> manually enable the Dreamy UI server via "MCP Tools."

### Visual Studio Code

> Make sure you have the
> [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
> and
> [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
> extensions installed.

In the `.vscode/mcp.json` file at the root of your project, add the MCP server
block:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "dreamy-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dreamy-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server is now ready to use. Click on Start on the MCP server.

### Claude Code

> Make sure you have Claude Code installed. Visit
> [Anthropic docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) for
> installation instructions.

Run the following command in your terminal to add the Dreamy UI MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add dreamy-ui -- npx -y @dreamy-ui/mcp
```

The MCP server is now ready to use. Start a Claude Code session by running
`claude`.

### Windsurf

1. <>Navigate to "Settings" > "Windsurf Settings" > "Cascade"</>

2. <>Click the "Manage MCPs" button, then click the "View raw config" button.</>

3. <>Add the following to the MCP configuration file (`.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`):</>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dreamy-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dreamy-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> You might need to click the "Refresh" button to see the MCP server in the
> list.

### Zed

1. <>Go to Settings > Open Settings</>

2. <>In the `settings.json` file, add MCP server as a new **context server**</>

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "dreamy-ui": {
      "source": "custom",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dreamy-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom MCP Client

To run the MCP server in a local or development environment using a custom MCP
client, you need to add the MCP server to the client's configuration file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dreamy-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dreamy-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
