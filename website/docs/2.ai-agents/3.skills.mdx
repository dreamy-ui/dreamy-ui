# Skills

Dreamy UI provides agent skills that you can use with AI assistants like Cursor to enhance your development workflow.

## What are Skills?

Skills are reusable, shareable capabilities that extend AI assistant functionality. Unlike rules (which contain everything to copy), skills are lightweight commands that install predefined functionality.

## Installation

To add Dreamy UI skills to your project, run:

```bash
npx skills add dreamy-ui/dreamy-ui
```

This command will install the Dreamy UI skills package, making specialized capabilities available to your AI assistant.

## Usage

Once installed, the skills will be automatically available to your AI assistant. The skills provide enhanced context and capabilities specifically tailored for working with Dreamy UI components and patterns.
