## Usage

Theme components allow you to lock specific sections of your UI to either dark or light mode, regardless of the global theme setting.

<Wrapper>
	<DarkTheme>
		<Box p={2} rounded={"l1"} bg="bg">This is Dark Theme</Box>
	</DarkTheme>
	<LightTheme>
		<Box p={2} rounded={"l1"} bg="bg">This is Light Theme</Box>
	</LightTheme>
</Wrapper>

```tsx
<DarkTheme>
	<Box p={2} rounded={"l1"} bg="bg">This is Dark Theme</Box>
</DarkTheme>
<LightTheme>
	<Box p={2} rounded={"l1"} bg="bg">This is Light Theme</Box>
</LightTheme>
```
