# Dreamy UI CLI

The Dreamy UI CLI helps you initialize and manage your Dreamy UI project with ease.

## Installation

The CLI is included when you install the `@dreamy-ui/cli` package:

```bash
pnpm add -D @dreamy-ui/cli
```

## Commands

### init

Initialize Dreamy UI in your project with automatic setup.

```bash
pnpm dreamy init
```

**What it does:**

1. Detect your framework (React Router v7, Next.js, or Vite)
2. Install all required dependencies (Panda CSS + Dreamy UI)
3. Create and configure `panda.config.ts`
4. Update `vite.config.ts` or `postcss.config.mjs` with Panda CSS PostCSS plugin
5. Remove default Tailwind CSS (React Router v7 and Next.js only)
6. Set up CSS files with proper imports
7. Create a `DreamyProvider` component
8. Update your `tsconfig.json` with `@/*` path alias and styled-system (if using TypeScript)
9. Next.js also gets `styled-system/*` path alias for proper type resolution
10. Run Panda CSS codegen to generate the styled-system
11. Add recommended components (button, flex, text, heading) to get you started
12. Prints out code to add to the root of your application

**Options:**

- `--yes, -y` - Skip all prompts and use defaults
- `--skip-install` - Skip dependency installation (useful if you want to install manually)
- `--skip-components` - Skip adding recommended components (button, flex, text, heading)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive setup with prompts
dreamy init

# Skip all prompts
dreamy init --yes

# Skip dependency installation
dreamy init --skip-install

# Skip adding default components
dreamy init --skip-components
```

---

### add

Add Dreamy UI components to your project.

```bash
dreamy add [components...]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add a single component
dreamy add button

# Add multiple components
dreamy add button input card

# Add all components
dreamy add --all

# Add components interactively
dreamy add
```

**Options:**

- `--all` - Add all available components
- `--force, -f` - Overwrite existing files
- `--dry-run, -d` - Preview changes without writing files
- `--outdir <dir>` - Specify output directory for components
- `--tsx` - Force TypeScript output

**What it does:**

1. Downloads component files from the registry
2. Installs component dependencies (other components)
3. Adds required recipes and patterns
4. Runs Panda CSS codegen

---

### list

List all available components in the Dreamy UI registry.

```bash
dreamy list
```

Shows a table of all available components with their names and descriptions.

---

### diff

Compare your local components with the registry versions.

```bash
dreamy diff [component]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Check differences for a specific component
dreamy diff button

# Check all components
dreamy diff
```

**What it shows:**

- Files that are up-to-date ✓
- Files that differ from registry ✗
- Files that don't exist locally →
- A detailed diff of changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### CLI not found

If you get a "command not found" error, try installing the command again:

```bash
pnpm install -D @dreamy-ui/cli
```

### Framework not detected

If the CLI can't detect your framework:

1. Make sure you have a config file (`next.config.js`, `react-router.config.ts`, or `vite.config.ts`)
2. The file should be in the root of your project
3. Try running from your project root directory

### TypeScript errors after init

After running `init`, you might need to:

1. Restart your TypeScript server (VS Code: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "Restart TS Server")
2. Run `npx panda codegen` to generate types
3. Check that `styled-system/**/*` is in your `tsconfig.json` include array

### Dependency installation fails

If dependency installation fails during `init`, run without installing dependencies:

```md
dreamy init --skip-install

# Then manually install dependencies
pnpm add -D @pandacss/dev @pandacss/postcss @dreamy-ui/cli
pnpm add @dreamy-ui/react @dreamy-ui/panda-preset motion
```

---

## Environment Variables

The CLI respects these environment variables:

- `HTTPS_PROXY` - Use a proxy for fetching components from the registry
- `REGISTRY_URL` - Override the default registry URL (for development)
