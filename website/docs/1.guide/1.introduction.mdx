# Introduction

Dreamy UI is a React UI library that provides a set of customizable components and utilities to build performant, websites with ease.

## Motivation

> info: Note: this isn't about which library is better, every library has its own pros and cons.

Many UI libraries are built on top of CSS-in-JS libraries like [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) or [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/). These libraries provide a great developer experience, but they come with a cost: they use runtime CSS styles, which slow down rendering, performance and limit some features, like streaming.

Dreamy UI is built on top of [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/), which is a CSS-in-JS library that provides strongly typed CSS styles, that are generated at **build time**, incredibly improving website performance and not decreasing developer experience.

## Solution

Introducing Dreamy UI, a library that allows you to write your favorite CSS-in-JS code, while still enjoying native CSS performance. Dream comes with many utilities to write your website even faster with Boolean style props. Let's say you are sure your flex component will be column, so instead of typing `flexDir="column"`, it is possible to write `col` or `column` as prop 🎉. You can mix and use any styling style to your preference.

Dream is highly customizable, meaning you can modify any component recipe in panda config.
If you have had used any CSS-in-JS library before, you are fully familiar with styling components and you'll have no problem with Dream.
