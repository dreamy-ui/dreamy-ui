# Customization

Dreamy UI depends on [pandaCSS](https://panda-css.com) as build-time css-in-js styling engine.
That means every customization related to styling should be done in panda config.

## Theming

Dream Preset contains only most basic styling options like background color, fonts, etc. If you want to customize more, you can extend the theme in panda config.

Most basic panda config would look like this. You can extend any theme property you want in `theme.extend` object.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
    preflight: true,
    jsxFramework: "react",
    jsxStyleProps: "all",
    outExtension: "js",
    include: [
        "./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    ],
    importMap: "@dreamy-ui/system",
    presets: [
        pandaPreset,
        createDreamPreset()
    ],
    theme: {
        extend: {
			/**
			 * Extend theme properties here
			*/
        }
    } 
})
```

> info: Tip: If body font is provided and heading font is not, Dream will automatically use body font for headings.

## Customizing Components

Every component in Dreamy UI has it's own recipe/slot recipe. Dreamy UI adds components to your project via CLI. That means you can go into recipes or patterns folder and manually edit the theme to your liking.

Do not forget to generate panda styled-system after changing the recipe or pattern.

```bash
pnpm panda codegen
```
