description: useSafeLayoutEffect is a `useLayoutEffect`, but uses `useEffect` during server side rendering.

## Import

```tsx
import { useSafeLayoutEffect } from "@dreamy-ui/react";
```

## Usage

`useSafeLayoutEffect` is a `useLayoutEffect` that is safe to use during server side rendering. It uses `useEffect` during server side rendering, skipping annoying and ugly `useLayoutEffect` warnings on server.

```tsx
/**
 * This will only run on the client, even SSR-ed.
 */
useSafeLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log("useSafeLayoutEffect");
}, []);
```
