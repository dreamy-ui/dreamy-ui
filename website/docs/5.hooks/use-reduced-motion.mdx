title: useReducedMotion
description: useReducedMotion returns a reduced motion state from a provider.
isServerComponent: false
source: /packages/react/src/provider/dreamy-provider.tsx
---

## Import

```tsx
import { useReducedMotion } from "@dreamy-ui/react";
```

## Usage

`useReducedMotion` will return a value that is provided into provider before hydration.

If `reduceMotion` in the provider is "system" (which is default by the way), it will resolve to a boolean value after hydration. Before hydration it will be a `false`. Else if boolean are provided, it will use them.

Try toggling the reduced motion in your system to see the effect.

<Wrapper>
	<UseReducedMotion />
</Wrapper>

```tsx
export function UseReducedMotion() {
	const isReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();

	return <Text>Is reduced motion: {isReducedMotion ? "Yes" : "No"}</Text>;
}
```
